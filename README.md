# Camplify
Camplify is an application for finding, reviewing, and uploading campgrounds.


## Features
The campgrounds page features a sortable grid of cards with all of the user-submitted campgrounds. Each card contains a link to the campground's unique page, which provides additional information and contains the campground's ratings and reviews. Creating an account enables users to create new campgrounds or rate, review, and favorite existing campgrounds. Each user account has a profile page containing the user's recent activity, posted campgrounds, reviews, favorites, and profile settings. Users can visit other profile pages if their profile visibility is set to 'public'.

## Technologies
Camplify is based on my final project for an online web development course. In this project, I've been able to implement the various technologies I've learned throughout the course. Camplify employs the following technologies:
- Node.js
- Express
- MongoDB / MongoDB Atlas
- EJS Templating for generating HTML
- CSS / Bootstrap
- jQuery

For a full list of the Node packages used by Camplify, please view the package.json file in the Github directory.

## Content
Camplify was created as an educational project for the purpose of learning new web technologies (especially back-end technologies) and practicing my web development skills. As such, all of the content on Camplify is fake. None of the campgrounds, reviews, or user accounts are real. All of the images, graphics, and icons are obtained from free online sources. Please feel free to create a new account or use Camplify's guest account (username: Guest, password: password).
